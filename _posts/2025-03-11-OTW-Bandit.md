# Introduction

This walkthrough covers the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire.org. I first came across it while working through HackTheBox and TryHackMe challenges. After earning a cybersecurity degree and several CompTIA certifications, I took a short break to focus on job hunting and work. But during that time, I realized I was starting to forget some of what I had learned—especially when it came to Linux, since I’ve always been more familiar with Windows. The Command Line Interface (CLI) still isn’t second nature to me, so I wanted to reinforce my skills.

That’s where OverTheWire: Bandit came in. It was the perfect way to refresh my knowledge and rebuild my confidence with Linux commands, file navigation, and basic security concepts. If you're just starting out in cybersecurity, this wargame is a great hands-on introduction to the CLI and how systems and networks work at a foundational level.

The purpose of this walkthrough is twofold:

    1. To document my experience solving Bandit so I have a reference for the future.
    2. To provide a beginner-friendly guide that makes cybersecurity concepts easier to     understand.
    
One thing I’ve noticed in my journey is that while tons of information is available, not all of it is accessible to newcomers. The cybersecurity world often pushes the mindset of "Try harder," but I believe in a different approach. Some people (myself included) learn best by seeing a tool in action first, then applying it in their own way later. Instead of struggling through dry man pages trying to find the right flags and use cases, I prefer a guided approach that makes learning smoother and more practical.

If that sounds like you, then you're in the right place! Let’s dive into Bandit and break it down step by step.

# About Bandit

The bandit wargame is designed to teach the fundamentals of Linux through the use of the command-line interface to look at file systems, navigation, and basic security concepts. Bandit consists of 34 levels in total and the premise is to try to find a flag that will be used to unlock the next level.
